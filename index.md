## WHAT WILL WE BE LEARNING IN THE WORKSHOP? 

We'll build a simple To-do app and deploy the database and backend on the cloud. We'll be using Python & Flask framework to build the backend, React JS to build the frontend, PostgreSQL for the database and finally Heroku to deploy our finished database and backend on the cloud.
